# Dark+ Python

## VsCode Dark+ theme with the same colours for python as javascript and a few extras for readability

* To allow for variable colouring, the source.python scope is set to the javascript variable colour (`#9CDCFE`) and all of the other scopes are set to other colours

* [Here](./themes/Dark+%20Python-color-theme.json) is the theme json file where you can see all the extra colours added

* If you're using the [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2) extension (which you should be), I recommend adding [these lines](./themes/bracket-pair-colorizer-2-settings.json) to your settings.json file

* To change your theme press Ctrl K and then Ctrl T

**Enjoy!**
